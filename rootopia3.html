<h3>The City of Tephra</h3>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The following day, Terra was ready to leave her home city of Umbra. Unaware of the real root of the problem, Terra was after the ones who were inspired by the Root, the nine Radishians. She did not know where to start looking, so she turned to <i>Twitter</i> to find information on the locations of each Radishian. After an hour of gathering information, Terra had set off for the nearest city, Tephra. The night that she arrived in the city, Terra had witnessed a Radishian capturing and selling other Turnip for various prices. This Radish had posted the Turnip on a newly created exchange website that changed every 12 hours.</p>
